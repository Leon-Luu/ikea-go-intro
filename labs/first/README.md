## Introduction to Go
ðŸ“‹ Write you first Go program. 
- create a folder to keep you go program files.
- open your favourite IDE and point it to the folder you just created.
- name your file as `main.go`

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello World!!")
}
```

## Running your first program
open terminal and change your directory to the go source folder you created for storing your files.

```shell
#run the below command where you have your first.go file
go run main.go
```
## Explore the go cli
```shell
#just write go on command line and press enter
go
```
